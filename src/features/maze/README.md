# Maze frontend feature

React owns the Maze page, the Create Game Wizard, Rooms browser, Room Details / Waiting Room and Live Races. `MazeMenu.tsx` is the React-owned presentation layer and subscribes to the immutable UI snapshot in `maze-ui-store.ts`.

`CreateGameComponent` is a DOM-free state adapter retained for the existing engine API. `LobbyHub` is a protocol/data coordinator only: it coordinates the existing WebSocket client and `LobbyStore`, then publishes snapshots and user actions to React. The lobby data store, sorting/filtering algorithms, room protocol and persisted preference keys remain independent of the view components.

The simulation remains an independent TypeScript engine. Maze generation, game state, Canvas rendering, frame loop, keyboard/pointer/joystick input, save format and multiplayer message protocol are not moved into React state. `MazeStage` and `LiveThumb` are canvas preview renderers with explicit React mount/unmount cleanup.

Remaining UI migration work includes the in-race HUD and Race Board, plus any other legacy presentation/bootstrap surface outside the four migrated menu views. The original static game DOM IDs are preserved as a compatibility boundary until those engine-facing surfaces are converted. Do not move high-frequency game-loop updates into React state.
