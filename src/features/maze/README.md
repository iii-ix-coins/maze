# Maze frontend feature

React owns the Maze page, the Create Game Wizard, Rooms browser, Room Details / Waiting Room and Live Races. `MazeMenu.tsx` is the React-owned presentation layer and subscribes to the immutable UI snapshot in `maze-ui-store.ts`.

`CreateGameComponent` is a DOM-free state adapter retained for the existing engine API. `LobbyHub` is a protocol/data coordinator only: it coordinates the existing WebSocket client and `LobbyStore`, then publishes snapshots and user actions to React. The lobby data store, sorting/filtering algorithms, room protocol and persisted preference keys remain independent of the view components.

The simulation remains an independent TypeScript engine. Maze generation, game state, Canvas rendering, frame loop, keyboard/pointer/joystick input, save format and multiplayer message protocol are not moved into React state. `MazeStage` and `LiveThumb` are canvas preview renderers with explicit React mount/unmount cleanup.

The Create/Rooms/Live menu, in-race HUD, Race Board, result cards and site-facing Maze controls are React-owned. The original static game DOM IDs remain as the engine compatibility boundary. The remaining imperative modules are limited to the independent simulation/render/input lifecycle and canvas-based visual effects; they are not UI controllers. Do not move high-frequency game-loop updates into React state.
